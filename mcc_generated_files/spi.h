  @Summary
    Initializes the SPI

  @Description
    This routine initializes the SPI.
    This routine must be called before any other MSSP routine is called.
    This routine should only be called once during system initialization.

  @Preconditions
    None

  @Param
    None

  @Returns
    None

  @Comment
    Init the SPI (mode 0) for maximum transfer speed

  @Example
    <code>
    uint8_t     myWriteBuffer[MY_BUFFER_SIZE];
    uint8_t     myReadBuffer[MY_BUFFER_SIZE];
    uint8_t     writeData;
    uint8_t     readData;
    uint8_t     total;

    SPI_Initialize();

    total = 0;
    do
    {
        total = SPI_Exchange8bitBuffer(&myWriteBuffer[total], MY_BUFFER_SIZE - total, &myWriteBuffer[total]);

        // Do something else...

    } while(total < MY_BUFFER_SIZE);

    readData = SPI_Exchange8bit(writeData);
